## Important Note  - You can also use dartPad ide as its free and available online but I used Dart for this
## What is Flutter?
Flutter is an **open-source UI software development framework** created by Google. It allows developers to build **natively compiled applications** for mobile (Android and iOS), web, and desktop from a **single codebase**. Flutter uses **Dart programming language** for development.

## Features of Flutter
- **Single Codebase**: Write one codebase and deploy it across multiple platforms.
- **Hot Reload**: Quickly see changes in the code without restarting the app.
- **Customizable Widgets**: Flutter provides a rich library of pre-built widgets and allows creating custom widgets for pixel-perfect designs.
- **High Performance**: Flutter apps are directly compiled to native code, ensuring smooth and responsive performance.
- **Platform-Specific Code**: Allows integrating platform-specific functionality, such as camera or geolocation.

## Where Flutter is Used
1. **Mobile Application Development**:
   - Create stunning, high-performance apps for both Android and iOS platforms.
2. **Web Development**:
   - Build interactive web applications that run on browsers.
3. **Desktop Application Development**:
   - Develop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
4. **Cross-Platform Applications**:
   - Design apps that work seamlessly across all supported platforms with a consistent look and feel.
5. **Prototyping and UI Design**:
   - Quickly build and test UI designs for mobile and web.

## Advantages of Using Flutter
- **Fast Development**: Hot reload accelerates the development process.
- **Expressive UI**: Leverage rich widgets to create beautiful, flexible designs.
- **Cross-Platform**: Deploy the same app on multiple platforms with minimal changes.
- **Community Support**: A large and active community ensures resources and help are easily available.
